# FilterData
Pure Python script to select collumns and filter data for the Brazilan Stock Market

This code filter lines and select columns for tick-by-tick data from Stock Market.

We may want to put the output files in a single file with "cat *.TXT > output.txt"

And also to remove blank lines with "sed '/^$/d' output.txt > output2.txt"
